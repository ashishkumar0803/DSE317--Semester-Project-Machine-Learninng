**Identification of Exoplanet Orbitals Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on identifying periodic drops in the light intensity of a star, known as "Transit Drops." These transit drops indicate the possible presence of an exoplanet or an exomoon. An exomoon is a natural satellite orbiting an exoplanet or other non-stellar extrasolar body. The successful classification of these transit drops is crucial for detecting exoplanets in NASA's Kepler Mission.

**Machine Learning Approach**

Various machine learning algorithms were explored to achieve the desired regression outcome. Among them, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm emerged as the most effective, yielding optimal evaluation results.

**Conclusion**

The identification of exoplanet transit drops is a critical aspect of exoplanet detection. This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to analyze Kepler Mission data, with KNN performing best for regression tasks.
